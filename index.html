        <h1>MD ARIF</h1>
        <p>
         I am MD ARIF. I am a frontEnd Developer. I love to develop the websites.
         This is my portfolio website where i have mentioned my skills , projects and contact details.
         I am desperate to learn new things every day and apply it to solve real life problems.
         I don't know all the concept of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT 
         but whenever i got stucked I googled it, understand their intuition and apply it on my project with my own logic. That's what real developer's does.
         Nowadays, I am learning React Library to design the websites in very efficient way.
         Initially, when i started learning the web development i was frustated many times. I thought this is not for me.
         But, When I explore all the Technolgy then I finally decided that i will stick to web development.
         Consistently, I was learning web development. Now, I am very confident that i can develop the websites.
        
        I am passionate towards Web Development.

            HTML Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
            HTML is the technology that we use to structure the website.
            HTML is the core of the website without HTML we cannot build websites.
            I have a good understanding of HTML through which I can structure any website.
            If I stucked somewhere while structuring the websites I googled it, and revised that concept.
            Using HTML only I have created the simple page like Walk through our first HTML where everything is created using HTML only.
            There are many tags which come under HTML like &lt;p&gt;tag, &lt;body&gt; tag,
            &lt;form&gt; tag, etc.
            We are using HTML5 to Structure the websites Nowadays.

            class="skill-logo"
          />
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style sheet.
            After structuring the websites we need some technolgy to beauty that website.
            That's what CSS does. Because of CSS users give attention to the websites.
            I have also good understanding of CSS topics like position,
            flex,background,media query etc.
            This is the second piller of the website.
            As a developer, what we are building it's for the user's if don't use CSS no user will visit on this website.
            There are so many concept in CSS. According to the situation , I googled it learn that topic and apply it on my project.
            By the use of CSS we can create animated websites which can attract the users.

               JAVASCRIPT is a scripting language.
               Once we build the website using HTML and CSS. There is something left to do that is websites cannot do anything it will only look pleasant.
               To make the website do something JAVASCRIPT came into the picture to solve the problem.
               JAVASCIPT gives action to the website.
               In JAVASCIPT everyting is object. JAVASCIPT has concept as other language has such as Arrays , Loops, Conditional Statements, OOPS concept etc.
               There is concept called DOM(Document Object Model) that gives JAVASCIPT power to change the HTML and CSS content.
               JAVASCIPT can be use as frontend as well as backend side.

          <p>
             React is a javascript Library.
             The reason that React came into the market is to solve the problem of updating the DOM tree.
             Whenever we update something the whole DOM tree gets updated that takes too much time and space.
             Then, React came up with solution that is Virtual DOM.
             In React, if you want to update some portion of HTML, it doesn't update the whole Virtual DOM ,it only update the requires part of that tree.

             In React, we divide the websites into various components.
             React is very famous because it has property of reusable components.
             React has a concept such as State, Hooks, Redux etc.
             Initially React component was build in class. Nowadays, React components are functional based.
